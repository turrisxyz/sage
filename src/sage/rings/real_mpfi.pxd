    # in this module, but they do affect the printing and the return
    # values of lower() and upper().  Consider a 3-bit
    # interval containing exactly the floating-point number 1.25.
    # In round-to-nearest or round-down, this prints as 1.2; in round-up,
    # this prints as 1.3.  The straightforward options, then, are to
    # print this interval as [1.2 ... 1.2] (which does not even contain
    # the true value, 1.25), or to print it as [1.2 ... 1.3] (which
    # gives the impression that the upper and lower bounds are not
    # equal, even though they really are).  Neither of these is very
    # satisfying, but I have chosen the latter for now.
